# Flight-Info
Script to get real world flight information for use with VATSIM

Search works a bit weirdly, for airports starting with a city name (London, Paris, etc.) the city name not the airport name must be specified.

Aircraft type is a search field, with the expception of Boeing aircraft where codes (B738, etc.) can be used.

## Requirements
Requires Python 3 and requests, daytime, and re packages.
